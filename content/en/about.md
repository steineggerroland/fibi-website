title: About Niva – and Why She Was Created

## Why Niva?

I didn’t create Niva because I’m great at staying organized.  
I created her because **I wasn’t**.

I forgot important appointments. Missed notes from daycare. Overlooked birthdays.  
I felt like a failure. Like someone who “just can’t get it together.”

I tried all kinds of tools – calendars, note-taking apps, bullet journals, Kanban boards, Obsidian, Slack reminders.  
None of them really worked for how my brain works.

## I didn’t need an app. I needed someone.

Someone who gently asks:  
> “Was there anything important after daycare?”  
> “Do you want to plan a break today?”  
> “Don’t forget the cake for the birthday party.”

Someone who’s present – **without being annoying**.  
Who doesn’t flood me with data.  
Who actually understands the kind of everyday life I’m living.

That’s how the idea for Niva was born:  
A small digital companion who reminds, helps structure, supports –  
without becoming overwhelming.

## Where Niva is heading

Niva is a passion project.  
And I want to keep building it – with your feedback.  
What’s on the roadmap:

- More automation (e.g. proactive planning suggestions)  
- Even smoother everyday integration  
- And maybe: an open-source version for full control and transparency

---

**I believe that structure doesn’t have to feel rigid.**  
That organizing your life shouldn’t feel like punishment.  
And that you deserve a way of living that fits *you*.

## About the Author

**Roland Steinegger** is the person behind Niva – and someone who knows firsthand what it feels like to forget tasks, miss appointments, or get buried under a mountain of to-dos.

As a father, software architect, and neurodivergent human, he’s experienced what “mental load” really means – especially when there’s cake to bake after daycare and important messages scribbled on notes that never made it to a list.

Niva was born from that everyday chaos: as a digital companion that gently reminds, checks in, and helps build structure – without adding stress.

Professionally, Roland has been developing secure web and cloud applications for years – always with the goal of making technology understandable, respectful, and useful. Whether in research, at **synyx**, as co-founder of the nonprofit **edudea e.V.**, or with startups like **leguli** – his focus has always been on building solutions that are practical and truly supportive.

> “When I forget something today, I make fun of my forgetfulness – instead of feeling ashamed. That’s just part of who I am sometimes.”

When he’s not working on Niva, he gives talks on AI, bakes pizza, or uses Niva to plan his next proper break.
