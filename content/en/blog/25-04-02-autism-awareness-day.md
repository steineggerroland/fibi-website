**“Not Invisible.”**  
That’s the theme of World Autism Awareness Day 2025. And it matters – because too often, autistic voices go unheard, unseen, or misunderstood.

But visibility isn’t about being loud.  
It’s about being *acknowledged*. Being *welcomed*. Being *safe to be who you are*.

## 🌟 Why visibility matters

True inclusion begins when we stop asking people to hide who they are.  
When autistic people are truly seen – not just noticed, but understood and respected – we all grow as a society.

Visibility isn’t a spotlight.  
It’s a window. One that lets others in.

## 📖 Stories that build bridges

This year, Autism Europe is sharing real stories – about everyday life, identity, challenges, joy, and quiet strength. Stories that show just how beautifully diverse the spectrum is.

And they’re inviting more voices to join in.
