**“Getting organized” can sound huge. Maybe even impossible.**  
Especially when your mind is busy – like with ADHD.

But structure doesn't have to be strict. Sometimes, all it takes is a soft nudge, a visual anchor, or a tool that meets you where you are.

## 🧷 1. Make things visible

Out of sight, out of mind – sound familiar?  
Sticky notes, whiteboards, or a visible daily plan can offload the pressure from your memory. You don’t have to hold it all – not if your space helps you remember.

## ⏱ 2. Start tiny

30 minutes feel too much? Go for 5.  
Just starting *a little* can help you gain momentum. And if not – that's okay too.

## 💬 3. Ask yourself kindly

Not: “Why can’t I get it together?”  
But: *“What would help me right now?”*  
Niva offers gentle prompts – never guilt.

## 🌿 4. Routine doesn’t mean rigid

Think of routines like plants – they grow with attention, not perfection.  
Especially with ADHD, a light structure can bring calm without becoming a cage.

## 🔍 5. Stay curious, not strict

Organization isn’t a final destination.  
It’s a path you shape around your needs – one that actually fits your brain. And that’s what matters most.
