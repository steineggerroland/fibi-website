title: Why I Created Niva – A Personal Story  
description: Niva didn’t start as a business idea. It started with real struggles, forgotten appointments, and a wish for someone who would gently help me organize life.

**I didn’t build Niva because I’m good at organizing.**  
I built her because I kept forgetting things. Appointments. Tasks. People.

And because I caught myself thinking:  
*“I’m a failure. I can’t do this. I’m an idiot.”*

## 💔 The moment that really hurt

One day, I forgot the birthday of someone close to me.  
No gift. No message. Just silence.

It made me deeply sad – because I knew it looked like I didn’t care.  
But I did. I just… forgot.

## 🧩 I had tried everything

Bullet journals.  
Beautiful notebooks, started with motivation – abandoned within weeks.  
Sticky notes, Trello boards, Wunderlist, Obsidian, Kanban systems.  
Slack reminders. Calendar blockers. Fancy Markdown routines.

They all worked *briefly*. Until life got in the way.  
Until the first early morning, the missed update, the one note I didn’t have with me.

## 🌱 What I really needed wasn’t an app – it was someone

Not another tool. Not a smarter system.

I needed someone who could say,  
> “Hey, anything from daycare you still need to note?”  
> “Want to add a break somewhere?”  
> “Hey, there’s a birthday coming up – need help preparing?”

Someone who would remind me **kindly**,  
who wouldn’t judge me,  
who could celebrate small wins with me – even if no one else saw them.

That’s how the idea for **Niva** came to life.  
A small companion who supports, structures, reminds –  
without pressure.

And because I care deeply about privacy, I wanted it all to be in **my own hands**.  
I don’t want to hand my life over to big tech.  
An open-source version of Niva is something I dream about – so that anyone can decide how to host or use her.

## 🧠 What Niva means to me today

- She greets me in the morning and shows me my day  
- After I pick up my son from daycare, she gently asks if there’s anything I forgot to note  
- She reduces my mental load – just by being interactive and present  
- She helps me break birthday prep into tiny steps  
- She helps me draft important emails  
- She suggests when I could pause – or breathe

It’s not magic.  
But sometimes, it feels like a little bit of it.

## 💬 What I want others to know

**Head up. It’s not your fault.**  
ADHD (or any neurodivergent brain) just makes organizing harder. That’s reality.

If I forget something today, I don’t spiral into shame anymore.  
I smile. “Oh, that’s my ADHD again.”

You don’t have to get it right every day.  
Routines will break. Focus will drift.  
That’s okay.

> Our job is to begin again.  
> And maybe have someone gently remind us: *You can.*

✨ I hope Niva can be that kind companion for you, too.

## About the Author

**Roland Steinegger** is the person behind Niva – and someone who knows firsthand what it feels like to forget tasks, miss appointments, or get buried under a mountain of to-dos.

As a father, software architect, and neurodivergent human, he’s experienced what “mental load” really means – especially when there’s cake to bake after daycare and important messages scribbled on notes that never made it to a list.

Niva was born from that everyday chaos: as a digital companion that gently reminds, checks in, and helps build structure – without adding stress.

Professionally, Roland has been developing secure web and cloud applications for years – always with the goal of making technology understandable, respectful, and useful. Whether in research, at **synyx**, as co-founder of the nonprofit **edudea e.V.**, or with startups like **leguli** – his focus has always been on building solutions that are practical and truly supportive.

> “When I forget something today, I make fun of my forgetfulness – instead of feeling ashamed. That’s just part of who I am sometimes.”

When he’s not working on Niva, he gives talks on AI, bakes pizza, or uses Niva to plan his next proper break.
