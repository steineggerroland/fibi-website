**Some days, everyday life feels like a wild river.**  
Everything rushes past, you try to hold on to something – and wonder: *“Where do I even start?”*

- They bring calm to sensory overwhelm 🌬  
- They give your day a frame – without fencing you in

It’s not meant to steer you – it’s here to **support you**.
