Routines bring predictability and calm – especially for ADHD, autism, or mental overload. But to be effective, they need to be gentle.

## Why routines are powerful

- They reduce cognitive load
- They provide grounding during sensory overload
- They make your day easier to shape

## How to build a routine that works for you

- Start with one small step (e.g. drinking water)
- Anchor it to something you already do
- Use tools like Niva to send friendly, timely nudges

## Routine ≠ Perfection

It's okay if your routine looks different every day. It's about support – not control.
