Getting organized can be tough – especially with ADHD. Rigid systems and overcomplicated apps often backfire. But there are gentler ways to create structure that works for your brain.

## 1. Make tasks visible

Visual reminders – like whiteboards or sticky notes – help offload memory pressure and bring clarity.

## 2. Work in small time blocks

30 minutes too much? Try 5. Tiny blocks reduce overwhelm and build momentum.

## 3. Use emotional check-ins

Instead of guilt, try asking: "What would feel helpful right now?" Niva nudges you gently without pressure.

## 4. Routines are support – not prison

Routines can soothe overstimulation. Make them flexible and meaningful to you.

## 5. Stay curious

Organization isn't a destination. It's a journey of small wins. Test, adapt, and go easy on yourself.
