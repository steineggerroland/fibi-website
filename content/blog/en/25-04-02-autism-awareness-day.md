**“Not Invisible”** – this is the theme of World Autism Awareness Day 2025. Once again, the focus is on making the autism community more visible, seen, and heard. Too often, the voices, perspectives, and needs of autistic individuals are overlooked.

## Why Visibility Matters

Visibility is the first step toward true inclusion. When autistic people are acknowledged, respected, and actively listened to, our communities become more empathetic and inclusive.

## Stories as a Bridge

Autism Europe is sharing personal stories that highlight everyday life, challenges, victories, and identity. These real-life experiences help break down stigma and show how diverse and vibrant the autism spectrum truly is.

You can join by submitting your own story or simply sharing the campaign with people around you. The more voices, the stronger the message.
